# DSAViz-Java
DSAViz is an algorithms visualiser built with JavaFX, FXML and Scene Builder for my final undergraduate project.

The app contains two sections: algorithms and data structures.
- Algorithms
  - Linear search
  - Binary search
  - Selection sort
- Data structures
  - Stacks
  - Queues

Each algorithm has a visualisation and a short lesson, while the data structures only have lessons.

## Algorithm Visualisations
Each visualisation screen contains:
- A main area for displaying an animation of the algorithm using numbers, colours, and pointers.
- An algorithm tracer for highlighting the lines of code as the algorithm runs.
- Reset and restart buttons.
- A slider for controlling the animation speed.
- Toolbar buttons for navigating to the homepage and the lesson page.
